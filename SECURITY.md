# OpenSauced Security Policy

If you believe you have discovered a potential security issue or vulnerability in OpenSauced, one of the OpenSauced experimental products, our backend systems, services we use, or anything that may compromise the integrity and well-being of our platform, please disclose it to us by emailing [security@opensauced.pizza](mailto:security@opensauced.pizza). Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, or any other public forum. Only report issues via the [security@opensauced.pizza](mailto:security@opensauced.pizza) email. An engineer from our team will be in touch with you as soon as possible.

### What to Include in Your Report?

Your report should include:

- A clear description of the issue, including steps to reproduce it.
- Any details you think would help us understand the potential impact of the vulnerability.
- Information about your system, the software you are using (such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.), and how you discovered the vulnerability.

### What to Expect After Reporting a Vulnerability?

Once submitted, your report will be reviewed by our engineering team. We will then work with you to understand more about the issue and, if verified, make all efforts to address the vulnerability promptly.

We appreciate your efforts in keeping our community, users, and products safe. Thank you for your support in responsibly disclosing any issues.

Bug bounty rewards are issued on a case-by-case basis and are at the discretion of OpenSauced leadership.
